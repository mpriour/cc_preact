# Preact

This project was bootstrapped with [Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli).

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install dependencies and then start up a development server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Adding the icons

The icon assets must be copied over to the assets folder manually. A `copy` script has been created to make this process easier:

```
npm run copy
```

This will copy the JSON assets required by the icon component to your project's `assets` directory.
